**Project description:** <br>
This project's objective is to analyse the outcome of the promotion and discontinue product with the least sale to minimise cost. This project was done in Microsoft's excel interactive dashboard with the data clean and prepare by using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.


### ERD

The Data collected needs to be clean, but before that we have to identify the relationship between the data. First, we have to  establish the Primary and Foreign keys of the data, as shown below before we clean the data and remove any unnecessary data field.

### SQL

Before starting the data analysis, I have used SQL studio to execute a few command. Command such as the following example of joining all tables to link all relationships of primary and foreign keys. Please download the presentation slides at the top of the page to view more of such SQL commands.

### Outlook of the interactive dashboard
I have assign the slicers to a few different category, mainly in the outlet in different region, quarters of the year, promotion status, cuisine, and food category. This helps to narrow down the dashboard to specific outcome when clicked on different slicers.

### Conclusion

With the help of this project, it allows me to understand the process of data preparation and the business objective. With the different slicers in place, the dashboard became interactive and allow user to drill down and analyse the specific data which gives a better picture to the targeted audience.
